Practical code example for mechanical analysis

The mechanical analysis used the same section as the previous practical example, but the physical parameters adopted were: (i) Modulus of Elasticity E_sec=24464 MPa; (ii) Poisson's ratio v=0.2; (iii) Specific weight of concrete γ_conc=22.1 kN/m^3 . and (iv) Specific weight of water γ_agua=9.81 kN/m^3 . The results obtained with the mechanical computational code are the nodal displacements in ∆_x and ∆_y, and the stresses in the elements in σ_x, σ_y and the shear τ_xy.

The mechanical example used 6351 nodes and 12324 CST elements, and the results of the stresses of the elements will be added with the values ​​of the flow obtained in the other practical example.

The result of the sum of the mechanical stresses with the flow values ​​in porous media per element is a form of One Way partial coupling.
